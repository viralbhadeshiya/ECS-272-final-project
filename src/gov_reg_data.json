        "initialNote": "C: On 21 December 2020, the EMA issued a positive opinion on the biontech/Pfizer vaccine and it was subsequently approved by the European Commission. On 28 December, this vaccine was administered for the first time in 3 Belgian residential care centres (located in Puurs, Brussels and Mons). From 5 January, this vaccination will be rolled out in all residential care centres. Currently, vaccines from two other companies, Moderna and Astra Zeneca/Oxford, are also undergoing the strict control of the EMA. The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed on 6 January 2021. If successful, the European Commission can give its final approval and green light for the use of this vaccine. Other potential vaccines will be examined later, including those from Johnson & Johnson or Curevac. Will the vaccine be available to everyone from the start? No. The vaccines will be produced continuously and quantity available will increase as they are delivered. Pending their large-scale production, several steps should be planned to best protect the most vulnerable groups and gradually increase individual immunity. (see question “Who are the priority groups?\") At the moment, it is difficult to provide a precise schedule for the administration of these vaccines. Therefore, monitoring the progressive availability of the vaccine per priority group is crucial. To increase the population’s immunity and to protect those most vulnerable from the virus, vaccination will take place in three phases, depending on the number of doses available. GROUP 1a First, the most vulnerable and exposed people will be vaccinated. Residents and employees of residential care centres and collective care institutions: since the outbreak of the pandemic, COVID-19 has hit elderly people hard, especially those living in residential care centres. They will be vaccinated first, followed by the staff (including volunteers), followed by collective care institutions. The medical staff from primary care and hospitals: they are in close contact with patients with Covid-19 on a daily basis. To protect them, they are vaccinated as a matter of priority. Next, the other staff in hospitals and health services will be vaccinated, including organisations responsible for prevention activities, such as vaccination and cancer screening centres, ONE and Kind en Gezin. In this first phase, this will require a special organisation and infrastructure (extremely low storage temperatures, multiple doses, etc.). GROUP 1b : vulnerable people without acute medical problems but at high risk In this phase it is expected that vaccines will become more widely available. It will then be possible to vaccinate larger groups of people. Priority will be given to people outside the hospital who are most at risk. These are the following groups: People over 65: people over 65 are the first priority at this stage. If sufficient vaccine is available, all these people can be vaccinated at the same time. Otherwise we start with the oldest people and then work our way down. People between 45-65 years of age with an increased risk: Then people between 45-65 years come with risk factors, such as: Diabetes, Hypertension, Chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver disorders, haematological cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis, All recent cancers (or recent cancer treatments) Obesity (Body Mass Index = 30). This list will be updated and expanded in the light of scientific developments, Essential professions: In this phase, people with essential social and/or economic professions are vaccinated. In this second phase, we can expect fewer logistical bottlenecks and organising the vaccination will be easier for these target groups. GROUP 2 - general population Thirdly, vaccine doses will be available in sufficient quantities to vaccinate the rest of the population. At this stage it can be expected that the doses can be stored and administered like other vaccines such as the flu vaccine)."

Since the implementation of the National Vaccination Program for COVID-19 began on 3 April 2021, a total of 14,876 people have received the COVID-19 vaccine, of which 14,526 people have received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 350 people have received the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. At present, the administration of COVID-19 vaccine is still being implemented for Phase One, consisting of frontliners, students studying abroad and senior citizens aged 60 and above. Priority is given to frontliners and especially the elderly because frontliners have a higher risk of being infected with COVID-19 and the elderly have a higher risk of getting more severe complications of COVID-19 infection. Without COVID-19 vaccine injections, clinical data obtained from around the world show those aged 60 and above are more likely to get the effects of more severe infections that require treatment in the Intensive Care Unit including respiratory assistance and have a higher risk of death as a result of the COVID-19 infection. Scientific studies have also shown that injection of COVID-19 vaccine can reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for the elderly and frontliners.\" Separate to the press release by the Ministry of Health, the Minister of Health also stated that “Brunei Darussalam will receive 200,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine and 300,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in addition to more than 100,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in several batches. This will help to cover the COVID-19 vaccination for 70 per cent of the population by end of this year,” confirming the future expansion of Brunei's vaccination programme to use the Pfizer-BioNTech (tozinameran) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines, and the use of these two vaccines will account for 55% of Brunei's population. On May 5, it was further announced that \"the number of people [in Brunei] receiving their second dose of vaccine has reached 862, while 15,043 have just received their first dose\".

Vaccines used: Oxford-AstraZeneca (AZD1222/ChAdOx1 nCoV-19); Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) The Ministry currently operates an opt-in programme for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, due to the very low risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia and related events the vaccine causes; alongside the National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy (where the Sinopharm vaccine is still being offered to the groups under Phase 1; and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is routinely used in individuals aged 60 and above). According to the Borneo Bulletin (owned by the Government of Brunei), \"[u]nder the opt-in programme for the Oxford-Astrazeneca COVID-19 Vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine will be made available free of charge to all citizens, permanent residents, and foreign long-term residents in the country from May 6–29. This is made available on a voluntary basis and offered to all individuals above 18 on a-first-come-first-served basis until May 29 or until all available doses have been utilised.\" Additionally, \"[t]his opt-in programme will run alongside to the prioritisation phases outlined in the National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy and allow individuals aged between 18 to 59 wishing to receive the vaccine earlier than they otherwise would be able to, the opportunity to do so with the AstraZeneca vaccine\" Furthermore, the report by Borneo Bulletin also mentions that \"[v]accination with other brands (at least including Moderna and Pfizer, as per the Health Minister's comments on 3rd May) for the general population is expected to commence in the fourth quarter this year\".

Here are the details: \"Now we have two different hours for the curfew, depending on the locality. On the one hand, in the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo, Santiago, Duarte, La Vega and Puerto Plata this applies every day from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am ”, explained Germán. While, in the rest of the country, the curfew applies from Monday to Friday from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. and Saturdays, Sundays and holidays from 7:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. The spokesperson for the Presidency clarified the limitations of the new measures in relation to transfer to homes. “At these times that we have indicated, all curfew restrictions begin to apply, including the closure of public spaces, with the only exception that those days and places in which the curfew begins at 7: 00 pm, a two-hour grace period has been granted, that is, until 9:00 pm with the exclusive purpose that people can move quietly home, without the anguish that they will be detained for reasons beyond their control, such as the traffic jams that usually take place in hours close to curfew ”. He added: “Regarding the gathering of people, it has been prohibited for more than 10 people to gather in public and private spaces for public use. This means that in these spaces more than 10 people can coincide at the same time, but they cannot gather in groups larger than that amount, as would happen in a shopping plaza, a transport station or a park ”. The same restriction applies to establishments such as restaurants and bars, where tables cannot be occupied by more than 10 people and always respecting the sanitary protocols of the sector, such as not exceeding 70% of the total capacity of the premises. “Finally, we wish to highlight that all the traffic exceptions during the curfew hours that we had previously, such as those relating to doctors and nurses and other health personnel, the one relating to international passengers heading or they return from the airport or the operators of vehicles dedicated to the distribution of food, supplies, fuels and other essential products, among other cases that can be detailed in article 4 of Decree 698-20, \"he said."

Today we registered the largest single-day COVID-19 caseload - 555 Romanians who were declared positive after being diagnosed. Over the last four weeks, we registered an increase in the number of cases from week to week. Unlike other countries, in Romania, the Government I am leading, had an approach of the gradual relaxation measures, with restrictions lifting phases, relaxation measures phases, once with opening the activities that have been under restriction in various phases, following increased interaction between people, we witnessed an increase in the number of cases from week to week. I conclude by conveying a message to every Romanian: The virus does not forgive anyone, nor does it forgive those who do not believe in the existence of the virus. If someone overlooks the rules, neglects and exposes himself to illness, when he becomes ill he not only endangers himself, he also endangers his loved ones, family members, relatives, colleagues, and friends. When you get sick you risk getting your loved ones sick as you may transmit the virus to those you are most often in close contact with. If you don't care about your health and you don't believe in this virus or you think this virus is not dangerous, please care about your brother, your mother, your father, your child, your friends, your colleagues. Only together, in solidarity and respecting simple rules, established by specialists, those who know very well how to fight against this virus, only together can we bring things back to normal and fight the epidemic effectively. I am confident that every Romanian will understand this watershed moment and will understand that success in the fight against the epidemic will solely depend on responsible and correct behaviour towards fellow citizens.
